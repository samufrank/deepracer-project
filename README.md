# DeepRacer RL Competition

Reinforcement learning project focused on reward function design for autonomous racing. 
Training a virtual race car using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) on AWS DeepRacer platform.

Objective: Optimize lap time through reward function engineering while maintaining track completion reliability.

Approach: Systematic experimentation with reward shaping strategies, analyzing training progression and failure modes.
